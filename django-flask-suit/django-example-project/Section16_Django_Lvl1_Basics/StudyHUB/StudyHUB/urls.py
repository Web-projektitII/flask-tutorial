# The include() function allows us to look for a match with regular expressions and link back to our applicationâ€™s own urls.py file.
# That wey, each application has its own urls.py file. We will have to manually create an urls.py file on each application.
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),          #here, when it finds a empty line, calls the views.index function
